    ">As the IT manager responsible for scrutinizing the functional aspects of the Snapchat mobile application in India, where the majority of users are on Android, it is imperative to gain insights from user feedback. The primary focus is on negative reviews on the Google Play Store, which often reveal critical issues faced by customers. The objective is to extract and analyze the latest 1 lakh reviews with ratings less than 3, specifically honing in on reviews with more than 5 words and written in English. Following this, conduct an emotional analysis to comprehend overall user sentiments. To refine the analysis, further scrutinize reviews containing the words \"issue\" or \"problem\" with accompanying emotions of \"anger\" or \"fear.\" Subsequently, interpret these specific reviews to provide actionable recommendations for enhancing the Snapchat application.\n",

Also, can you please make it so that there is atleast a remove button for the AI? It is extremely annoying to click on it. However, this is a really good app to talk with friends.',\n",
